## 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm **Xu Wang**, currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence at **The University of Hong Kong (HKU)** 🧠, expected to graduate in 2025. I hold a B.Eng. in Information Systems from **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**, where I graduated with a GPA of **3.93/4.0** 📚.

My research focuses on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with particular interest in:
- 🧩 *Interpretability & circuit tracing*
- 🧪 *Fine-tuning mechanisms (LoRA, AdaLoRA, IA3)*
- 🩺 *Safe applications in healthcare*
- 🛡️ *Responsible AI and AI alignment*

Currently, I am a research assistant at HKU and CUHK (Shenzhen), working on projects related to **LLM interpretability and AI safety**.

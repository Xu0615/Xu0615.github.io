## About Me

I am **Xu Wang**, currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence at **The University of Hong Kong (HKU)**, expected to graduate in 2025. I hold a B.Eng. in Information Systems from **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**, where I graduated with a GPA of 3.93/4.0.

My research focuses on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, particularly in **interpretability, fine-tuning mechanisms, and safe applications in healthcare**. I am currently a research assistant at HKU and CUHK (Shenzhen), working on projects involving **LLM mechanistic interpretability, circuit tracing**, and **responsible AI applications**.

## Research Experience

- **Circuit Changes in Fine-tuned LLMs**  
  *Accepted by ICLR 2025 Workshop*  
  Investigated structure-level changes in circuits under various fine-tuning strategies (SFT, LoRA, AdaLoRA, IA3) across GPT2-xl, Pythia, and Llama models.

- **Generative AI for Healthcare Applications**  
  *Accepted by SEDSI 2025*  
  Fine-tuned Llama 3.1-8B for medical Q&A using knowledge graphs and built an RAG-based vector database using LangChain.

- **Multi-choice Reasoning with Phi2**  
  Enhanced multiple-choice Q&A accuracy through in-context learning and embedding selection.

## 👋 About Me

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student (Fall 2025 intake) in Artificial Intelligence at the [School of Computing and Data Science (CDS), The University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.cds.hku.hk/), advised by [Prof. Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io/). Previously, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in 2023 from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and obtained my Master’s degree in 2025 from the Faculty of Science, The University of Hong Kong.

My research focuses on **AI Interpretability, Trustworthy and Safety**, aiming to better understand Large Language Models (LLMs) and to design more advanced and safer AI. In particular, I am actively exploring [**Circuit Analysis**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11812) and [**Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03659), with the long-term goal of (1) understanding how LLMs work internally, (2) improving their performance, and (3) building models that are safer and more controllable.

If you would like to get in touch or share a passion for LLM interpretability and safety, or if you are looking for potential collaboration in this direction, feel free to reach out via email: **sunny615@connect.hku.hk**!

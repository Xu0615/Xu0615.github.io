## 👋 About Me

I am currently a research assistant at the [School of Data Science (SDS), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/), where I work under the supervision of [Prof. Lihai Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=z8_x7C8AAAAJ) and [Prof. Benyou Wang](https://wabyking.github.io/old.html). My research focuses on **[LLMs Interpretability & Trustworthy AI](https://www.anthropic.com/research#interpretability)**, aiming to better understand large language models and to design more advanced and safer AI systems.

Previously, I earned my Bachelor’s degree from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) and obtained my Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from the [Faculty of Science, The University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.scifac.hku.hk/). I am also an incoming Ph.D. student in AI at the [Department of Data Science, HKU](https://datascience.hku.hk/), advised by [Prof. Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io/).

My current research interest lies in understanding the inner mechanisms of large models to plan for a future of safe AI. In particular, I am actively exploring **Circuit Analysis** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11812) and **Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)** (https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html), with the long-term goal of (1) understanding how LLMs work internally, (2) improving their performance, and (3) building models that are safer and more controllable.

If you would like to get in touch—or share a passion for LLM interpretability and safety—feel free to reach out via email: **sunny615@connect.hku.hk**.
